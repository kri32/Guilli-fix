 gpm_d_forgotten_deposit_desc: "£gpm_planet_wonder£  §HPlanetary Wonders§! are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nInitially described as nuclear shelters, these enormous facilities are indeed long forgotten deposits. No traces of the previous owners were found, though most of these automated facilities remains operational. It contains considerable amounts of ultra-heavy chemical elements, preserved in large tanks of a strange technology, almost as if frozen in time. Sadly, a few damaged sections seem to have been leaking highly radioactive content for hundreds of years. The preserved elements bear uncalculable rarity, and synthesization is extremely difficult. Also, present containment technology could barely slow the decay outside the tanks."

 gpm_d_ruined_arcology: "£gpm_planet_wonder£  §ERuined Arcology§!"
 gpm_d_ruined_arcology_desc: "£gpm_planet_wonder£  §HPlanetary Wonders§! are unique rare planetary features that provide powerful bonuses.\n\nOnce a thriving acropolis, these colossal ruins represent the pinnacle of sustainable architecture.
