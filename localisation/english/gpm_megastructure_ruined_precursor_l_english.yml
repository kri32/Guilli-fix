 # exploration events
 # Ruined Refinery
 gpm_mega.1.name: "Colossal Blip"
 gpm_mega.1.desc: "As soon as we entered the §Y[from.GetName]§! system our sensors registered a giant blip. A single large structure is kept in orbit over a gas giant. This warrants further investigation."

 # Ruined Mining Facility
 gpm_mega.2.name: "Unusual Emissions"
 gpm_mega.2.desc: "One of the asteroids in the §Y[from.GetName]§! system is emitting a stream of fine particle dust. It seems to be leaking minerals! There must be a structure nearby."

 # Ruined Station
 gpm_mega.3.name: "Debris"
 gpm_mega.3.desc: "Sensors are picking up unusual emissions coming from deep within the §Y[from.GetName]§! system. A very large, abandoned station surrounded in dangerous debris seems to be orbiting a seemingly uninteresting planet. Perhaps something might be salvaged from this."

 # Ruined Silo
 gpm_mega.4.name: "Subspace Warning"
 gpm_mega.4.desc: "Several automated warnings started blaring as soon as we entered the §Y[from.GetName]§! system. It seems something is emitting very strong subspace signals. Scanners detect a large structure at the edge of the system, likely to be the source of these strange emissions."
